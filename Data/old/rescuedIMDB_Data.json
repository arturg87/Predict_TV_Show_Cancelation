The one issue i have is how short the episodes are, which means if you watch the trailer for the series you've already seen half of the first episode. There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.\"go to your happy place\" \"what is that? that sounds stupid.\"There's also the expressionless, unreadable openly gay police captain who is anything but a gay stereotype, the sociopathically manipulative secretary who in her own words \"thrives on dysfunctional relationships\", and detective scully who is in every sense of the word a failure, smelly, lazy, unadept and just all around a horrible police officer. Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. Overall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

While successful police dramas have ruled the airwaves for decades, the same cannot be said for cop shows that aim for laughs. There are some noticeable exceptions such as \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and the very short-lived \"Police Squad\", but for the most part, it has been hard for show-runners to make crime a funny topic on TV. \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" could have ended up being super broad like \"Police Academy: The Series\" or \"Reno 911\", but luckily creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur have made the decision to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality, allowing for viewers to relate to the characters without them becoming complete cartoons. In casting Andy Samberg as the lead, there was the risk of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" coming across too goofy. However, Samberg is at his career best here as Jake Peralta, a childish and immature detective who just happens to be very good at his profession. Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.If \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.Although there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10", "percent_found_helpful": 70.4}, {"review_score": "7", "review_UID": "Dunning-Kruger", "review_date": "19 September 2013", "review_title": "A surprisingly pleasant, silly yet witty show.", "review_text": "After first hearing about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I was fairly skeptical about yet another attempt on Fox's part to regain their former position as king of network comedy, however; minutes after it had started, I was able to find an affection for this show that I haven't had for a comedy pilot since The Office.Anchored in large part by Andy Samberg's ironic sense of humor, it also features plenty of dead-pan humor and caricatures, much of it being a parody of the typical crime drama.Half-way through, I realized it felt fairly reminiscent of The Office's early days, unbeknownst to me that was intended to channel that style and humor, despite it not being a mockumentary.Personally, I felt it to be one of the strongest pilots for a comedy I had seen in a while. They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clich\u00e9s of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.", "percent_found_helpful": 69.66}, {"review_score": "9", "review_UID": "jodyfranz", "review_date": "11 September 2018", "review_title": "Genuinely funny, light hearted, fast paced comedy", "review_text": "I tend to have to find things in between a kids show and adult shows so the whole family can watch and not want to pull our hair out listening to Peppa Pig's annoying voice. 99 did the trick for us.

The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! The producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest.

Thankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \"cop show\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.The cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \"star\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \"Parks and Recreation,\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise.

Despite this all of the characters are amazing as they are all likable and have incredible chemistry which makes this show one you should watch.It mainly follows Jake Peralta who is a guy who loves his work, is incredibly immature and usually takes inspiration from action films like Die Hard whilst on a case. The show always follows the other characters in engaging and hilarious plot lines which also shows off different traits and experiences of their separate characters. Whilst it is an amazing show, it has it's flaws such as every finale has started to end in mostly the same way and the first couple of episodes of the next series will be centred around this one thing. As with any show there are some episodes that are not as good as the others, however after 4 seasons there are no seriously bad episodes so that is great.One last issue is that there is a duo in the precinct called Hitchcock and Scully who exist solely to be gross out characters (Which I don't particularly mind) and are essentially the exact same character, however they can be really funny and they do have characteristics even though they have the least amount of character development than anyone else in the show.

It's primarily comedy, but little splashes of every other genre are in there. The premise is a group of characters working together at a detective agency and it is basically a satire cop show, one episode even has them on the set of another cop show.\nIt always has the scenario being the opposite of what you'd expect without anybody going too far out of character. Even when you're trying to expect the opposite of the obvious, it still is unpredictable and makes you laugh out loud. The main character is Jake Peralta, he's a really good detective and he's really immature. He is obsessed with the movie 'Die Hard' and apparently hasn't been to a dentist in seven years.\nTheir gay, black Captain has barely any facial expression and is often described as robotic, until season two, they give him an arch nemesis, bringing out his immature side, this may not sound like a comedy character, but trust me when i say it is. \nAmy Santiago is your stereotypical 'teacher's pet', but that doesn't mean that the humour gets old after a while, she's also extremely competitive. Charles Boyle is possibly the funniest character on the show, he's Jake's best friend, he's jealous of all of Jake's other friends and is obsessed with food. He also doesn't seem to realise how some things sound, for example, in one episode after he punches somebody, he spits them and says 'I've got a lot more where that came from, I've got a real wet mouth'. \nRosa Diaz is also an amazing character, for the first few seasons, she is kind of emotionless. She's considered the badass in the group.\nGina Linetti isn't a detective, she's a secretary. She's basically a walking stereotype of the 'kids these days', she says that C- is the perfect grade because 'you pass, but you're still hot', she barely does anything apart from use her phone and uses way too many abbreviations, for some reason, she'll always win a battle though.\nHitchcok and Scully are the two most useless detectives on the force. They should've retired long ago, but hey, why not creep everybody out and get diabetes. They're basically one person, don't get me wrong they do have some unique traits, however. Why they haven't been fired, I'll never figure that out.\nTerry Jeffords is the last main character, it's hard to explain what's funny about him but he just is funny. He's the second in command after the captain, he's really muscular and he loves yogurt. Despite this, he's still a funny character due to his one liners.\nAnother thing that I love about this show is the things that'll usually occur once a season, they have several things that'll happen once in every season, it's hard to explain what I mean, my two favourites of these are the pontiac bandit and the halloween heist. The pontiac bandit is a criminal that Jake is kind of friends with, but he also wants to send him to jail, he's extremely funny. The halloween heist is a bet that was made in season one between Jake and the Captain, Jake had to steal the Captains medal of valor by midnight, they did a variation on the bet the next year, and the year after that, a variation on the variation and it's extremely funny and unpredictable.\nAs well as humour it has great ongoing storylines ranging from friendships to taking down serial killers.\nTo summarise, if you still don't want to watch the show, then you need to see a therapist.", "percent_found_helpful": 57.14}, {"review_score": "10", "review_UID": "stupotrugby", "review_date": "27 July 2015", "review_title": "Brilliant!!!", "review_text": "A genuinely funny series with likable characters and great mini stories in each episode! Perfectly cast, Captain Holt is brilliantly dry, Peralta suitably brilliant and child like! I struggle to find anything negative to say about this great show.

It is at times silly and juvenile but more wity good set pieces and more sophisticated humour ot balances perfectly.

After watching a few episodes it felt as if that's the type of audience they were shooting for yet seemed to miss. The Office, while being fairly low-brow and borderline slap- stick, at least was able to deliver jokes and circumstances that were believable yet absurd at the same time and many can relate to this if you've ever been in a cubicle style office job for any extended period of time.Brooklyn Nine-Nine, to me, missed that gray area between the totally absurd and a documentary of a police station. Instead of riding that fine line, which makes a comedy work, they went too far off into absurdity land and anything there to anchor them back to reality is too far removed that this eventually begins to feel like a show full of absurd police-precinct jokes and 60 second skits mashed together to form a thoroughly blended plot. To top all of it off, the absurdities in these skits are executed by equally absurd character personalities.I actually like some of the actors in this show like Terry Crews, Andre Braugher and to a lesser extent Andy Samberg and I think with some re- tooling of the writing it could really work. I'm honestly confused as how the judges for the Golden Globe could pick this as the best comedy TV series.

I like the fact that it's sometimes over the top and soooo unlike any of the other shows, ie,...the seriousness of every other cop show out there. EVERY other cop show out there is very serious. They tackle corruption, killings, spousal abuse, drugs, etc...and the detective work involved. The only difference between every other cop show out there is that they are filmed at different locations, with different actors, and had different writers...writing about the same topics.I think Bklyn 9-9's writing is silly, funny, and over the top. The characters mesh perfectly and I sometimes laugh almost as soon as the characters start with their retort. If you are the serious type and can't relax, do not watch the show. If you are constantly evaluating the cop tactics, how the chain of command functions, the way the uniforms look and cop jargon, do not watch the show.

Not unlike a movie trailer, the TV spots show all of the funny parts out of context. When you see those same lines in context, they become very unfunny. That is an amazing feat.
